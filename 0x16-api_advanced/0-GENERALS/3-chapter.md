Pagination is a common technique used in APIs to handle large datasets by splitting them into smaller, manageable chunks or pages. When working with paginated APIs, you typically receive a subset of data with each request and use parameters to navigate through the pages of results.

Let's break down the key concepts and steps involved in using an API with pagination:

1. **Understanding Pagination Parameters**:
   - **Page Number**: Some APIs use a page number parameter to specify which page of results to retrieve. For example, `page=1`, `page=2`, etc.
   - **Limit/Offset**: Another approach is to use a limit parameter to specify the number of results per page and an offset parameter to specify the starting point of the page. For example, `limit=10` to limit each page to 10 results and `offset=20` to start from the 21st result.

2. **Making Requests**:
   - Send an initial request to the API without any pagination parameters to retrieve the first page of results.
   - Review the response to understand the structure and extract relevant data.
   - If the API supports pagination, the response may include information about the next page (e.g., a URL or a token).

3. **Processing Responses**:
   - Process the data from the current page.
   - If the response includes pagination information (e.g., a "next" link or a "next page" token), use that information to construct the URL for the next page.

4. **Iterating Over Pages**:
   - Repeat the process of making requests and processing responses for each subsequent page until you've retrieved all the desired data or reached the end of the dataset.

Let's practice using an example API that supports pagination. We'll use the GitHub API to fetch a list of repositories for a specific user with pagination.

We can then implement a function to fetch all repositories for a given user by iterating over all pages of results using pagination parameters.
