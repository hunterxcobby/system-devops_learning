The benefits of using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) with an SSL certificate include:

1. **Encryption of Customer Information**:
   - HTTPS encrypts sensitive customer data, such as credit card numbers, ensuring that it cannot be intercepted by malicious actors while in transit between the user's browser and the website.

2. **Verification of Identity and Ownership**:
   - Websites using HTTPS display a padlock icon in the browser's address bar, indicating a secure connection.
   - Extended Validation (EV) certificates turn the address bar green, providing visual assurance to visitors that the website belongs to a registered business and that the domain ownership is verified.

3. **Enhanced Trust and Credibility**:
   - Customers are more likely to trust and complete transactions on websites that use HTTPS, as it provides assurance of data security and authenticity.
   - HTTPS contributes to building trust between the website and its visitors, ultimately improving the credibility of the site and the business it represents.

In summary, HTTPS not only encrypts sensitive information for security but also enhances trust and credibility by verifying the website's identity and ownership, thereby fostering a safer and more trustworthy online environment for users.
