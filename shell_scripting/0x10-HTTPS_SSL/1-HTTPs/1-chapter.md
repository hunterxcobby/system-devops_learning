Let's break down the differences between HTTP and HTTPS:

1. **HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)**:
   - **Definition**: HTTP is a protocol used for transferring hypertext requests and information on the World Wide Web.
   - **Usage**: It's the foundation of data communication on the web and is commonly used for accessing websites, retrieving HTML pages, submitting form data, etc.
   - **Security**: HTTP does not provide any encryption, meaning data transmitted over HTTP is sent in plain text. This makes it susceptible to interception and eavesdropping by malicious actors.
   - **Examples**: When you visit a regular website without seeing a padlock icon in the address bar, it's likely using HTTP.

2. **HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)**:
   - **Definition**: HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, designed to provide encrypted communication over a computer network, typically the internet.
   - **Usage**: It's used for secure online transactions, such as online banking, e-commerce, and any other activity where sensitive data is exchanged.
   - **Security**: HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the browser and the website, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. This encryption prevents attackers from intercepting and reading sensitive information.
   - **Indicators**: Web browsers display a padlock icon in the address bar to indicate that the connection is secure and HTTPS is in use.
   - **Examples**: When you visit a banking website or enter personal information on an e-commerce site, you'll typically see HTTPS in the URL and a padlock icon, indicating a secure connection.

In summary, while HTTP is used for general web browsing and data transfer, HTTPS is essential for secure transactions and protecting sensitive information online. The 'S' in HTTPS stands for 'Secure,' indicating that the communication between your browser and the website is encrypted, ensuring privacy and security.
