HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for exchanging information on the internet. Initially, it allowed for the easy sharing of information between network administrators, but it lacked security measures to protect data from interception.

To address this vulnerability, administrators developed HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure). HTTPS encrypts data using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols. This encryption ensures that even if intercepted, the data remains unreadable to unauthorized parties.

HTTPS relies on SSL certificates, which contain public keys used for encryption. The owner shares the public key with others, allowing them to encrypt messages sent to the owner. However, the private key, necessary for decrypting messages, remains secure and is not shared.

The security provided by HTTPS, SSL, and TLS during data transfer is collectively known as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This infrastructure ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged over the internet.
