An SSL certificate is required for several important reasons:

1. **Encryption of Communications**:
   - Without encryption, communications over regular HTTP connections are transmitted in plain text.
   - This poses a significant security risk, as hackers can intercept and read this data.

2. **Protection of Sensitive Information**:
   - Sensitive data, such as credit card details or social security numbers, transmitted over HTTP connections are vulnerable to interception.
   - HTTPS encrypts all communications, ensuring that even if intercepted, the data remains secure and unreadable to unauthorized parties.

3. **Prevention of Data Interception**:
   - With HTTPS, all data exchanged between your browser and the website is securely encrypted.
   - In the event of a breach in the connection, attackers cannot decipher the encrypted data, thus preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

In essence, an SSL certificate is essential for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the privacy and security of communications between users and websites, especially during online transactions involving confidential data.
