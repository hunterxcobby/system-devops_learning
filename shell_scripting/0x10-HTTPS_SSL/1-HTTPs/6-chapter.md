HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) are both protocols used for communication between web browsers and web servers. However, they differ in terms of security and how they transmit data:

1. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**:
   - HTTP is the standard protocol used for transferring data over the internet.
   - It operates over a plain text connection, meaning that data is transmitted in an unencrypted format.
   - Requests and responses between the client (web browser) and the server are sent in plain text, making them susceptible to interception and eavesdropping by malicious parties.
   - While HTTP is suitable for general browsing and transferring non-sensitive information, it lacks security measures to protect confidential data such as login credentials or financial information.

2. **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)**:
   - HTTPS is an extension of HTTP that adds a layer of security by using encryption to protect data transmitted between the client and the server.
   - It operates over a secure, encrypted connection established using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security).
   - When a user accesses a website using HTTPS, their browser and the web server negotiate an encryption key (the "code") to secure the communication.
   - All data exchanged between the client and server, including sensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal details, is encrypted before transmission.
   - This encryption ensures that even if intercepted, the data remains unreadable to unauthorized parties, providing a higher level of security for online transactions and sensitive interactions.

In summary, while HTTP facilitates communication between web clients and servers over the internet, HTTPS enhances security by encrypting data transmission, thereby safeguarding sensitive information from interception and unauthorized access.
