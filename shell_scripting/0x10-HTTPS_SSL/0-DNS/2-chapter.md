Let's break down how Round Robin DNS works using a simple analogy:

Imagine you're hosting a party and you want to make sure everyone gets a chance to talk to two of your friends, Alice and Bob. However, Alice and Bob are both popular and have lots of guests wanting to talk to them.

To manage the crowd, you decide to use a Round Robin system. You tell everyone to line up in front of two tables labeled "Alice" and "Bob." As guests arrive, they join the line for either Alice or Bob, alternating between the two tables.

Here's how it works:

1. **DNS Configuration**: Similarly, when someone wants to connect to your website foo.dnsknowledge.com, their computer first checks with the DNS server to get the IP address. Instead of getting just one IP address, the DNS server gives out a list of IP addresses associated with foo.dnsknowledge.com. In this case, it gives out two IP addresses: 202.54.1.2 and 202.54.1.3, which represent the servers hosting your website.

2. **Distribution of Requests**: Now, when someone tries to access your website, their computer randomly picks one of the IP addresses from the list provided by the DNS server. Let's say the first request goes to 202.54.1.2 (Alice's table), and the next request goes to 202.54.1.3 (Bob's table). This continues, with requests alternating between the two IP addresses.

3. **Balancing Load**: By distributing requests between the two IP addresses, Round Robin DNS ensures that the load is evenly balanced between the servers. It's like ensuring that both Alice and Bob get to interact with guests at the party without one table getting overcrowded.

4. **Handling Traffic**: This method helps in managing traffic effectively. If one server becomes busy or goes down, the other server is still available to handle requests. It's like having a backup plan at the party â€“ if one table gets too crowded, guests can still interact with the other friend.

So, Round Robin DNS works by providing multiple IP addresses for the same hostname and rotating requests between them, ensuring even distribution of traffic and efficient handling of requests among multiple servers, just like managing guest interactions between friends at a party.
