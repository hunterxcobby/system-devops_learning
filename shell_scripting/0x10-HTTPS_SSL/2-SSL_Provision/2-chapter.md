Imagine you're sending a secret letter to a friend through a postal service. Without encryption (like SSL), anyone along the way could open and read your letter. But with encryption, it's like sealing your letter in a special envelope that only your friend's secret key can open.

Similarly, when you send sensitive information over the internet, like credit card numbers or passwords, it's like sending a digital letter. Without encryption, hackers could intercept and read this information. However, SSL acts like that special envelope, encrypting your data so only the intended recipient, like the website server, can unlock and read it.

So, SSL encrypts your sensitive information, turning it into unreadable code during its journey across the internet. This way, even if someone tries to intercept it, they can't decipher it without the right key. It's like sending a secret message that only the intended recipient can understand, keeping your data safe from prying eyes and potential identity thieves.
