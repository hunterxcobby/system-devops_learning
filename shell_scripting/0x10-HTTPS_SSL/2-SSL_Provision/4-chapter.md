Think of SSL trust like a security badge for your website. Just as people feel safer entering a building with visible security guards, web users feel more secure when they see visual cues like a lock icon or a green bar in their browser.

When visitors see these indicators, they know your website is secure and trustworthy, which boosts their confidence in making transactions or sharing sensitive information. SSL providers also offer trust seals, akin to official certifications, further reassuring visitors of your website's security.

Moreover, HTTPS protects against phishing attacks, where criminals impersonate legitimate websites to steal information. Since these attackers can't easily obtain SSL certificates for their fraudulent sites, users become wary when they don't see the expected trust indicators in their browser. This awareness helps users recognize and avoid phishing attempts, safeguarding their data from potential threats.
