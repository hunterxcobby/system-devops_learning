### What is a Process?

- **Definition:** A process is described as an instance of a program in execution. In simpler terms, if a program is executed multiple times, each execution is considered a separate process.

- **Multiple Instances:** If the same program is run multiple times, each execution creates a distinct process. For example, if a program is run 10 times simultaneously, there will be 10 corresponding processes.

- **Unique Process ID (PID):** Each process is identified by a unique Process ID (PID). The PID serves as a numerical identifier that distinguishes one process from another in the system.

- **Parent Process ID:** Additionally, each process is associated with the Process ID of its parent process. Understanding the parent-child relationship between processes is crucial for managing and organizing the execution flow.

### The main() Function

- **Role:** In the C programming language, every C program begins its execution with a call to the `main()` function.

- **Entry Point:** The `main()` function serves as the entry point for a C program. It is the first function that gets called when the program is executed.

- **Execution Flow:** All subsequent execution flows in the program are determined by the logic defined within the `main()` function. It is within this function that the primary operations and functionalities of the program are coded.
