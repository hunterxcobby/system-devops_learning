### Understanding Program Execution and Special Parameter $? in Bash

#### Program Execution Lifecycle:

1. **Execution Trigger:**
   - When a C program is executed, the kernel uses the `exec` function to initiate the program.

2. **Startup Routine:**
   - Before the `main()` function, a typical startup routine is called. This routine handles aspects like gathering command-line arguments and environment information.

3. **Main() Function Execution:**
   - The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It receives data passed by the startup routine, including command-line arguments.

4. **End Routine:**
   - When the program completes execution, a typical end routine is called. This routine handles any necessary cleanup.

#### Special Parameter $?:

- After the program execution, the return value from the `main()` function is sent to the terminal.

- In Bash, the special parameter `$?` can be used to check the return value.

#### Example:

```bash
$ echo $?
0
```

#### Explanation:

- The `echo $?` command prints the return value from the last executed command.

- A return value of `0` typically indicates a successful execution. Any other value suggests an issue or failure during execution.

#### Linking Stage and Routines:

- In the compilation process, the linker plays a crucial role.
  
- The linker specifies the addresses of the startup and end routines as the first and last routines to be called, respectively.

- This setup ensures that necessary processes, such as gathering command-line arguments, are handled before the `main()` function starts executing.

#### Conclusion:

- Understanding the program's lifecycle, from startup routines to the execution of the `main()` function and the end routine, provides insight into how C programs are executed and managed by the operating system.
