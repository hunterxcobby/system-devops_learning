In Linux, a **signal** is a software interrupt delivered to a running process, notifying it that a specific event has occurred. These events can range from simple notifications, such as the termination of another process, to requests for a process to perform specific actions, like reloading its configuration.

Imagine you're working on your computer, and you press Ctrl+C to interrupt a running program; in this case, you're sending a signal to that program, telling it to stop. Similarly, if a program encounters an error, it might receive a signal indicating that it should terminate gracefully.

Signals provide a way for the operating system, or other processes, to communicate with each other. They can be used for various purposes, including handling errors, controlling process behavior, and facilitating inter-process communication.
