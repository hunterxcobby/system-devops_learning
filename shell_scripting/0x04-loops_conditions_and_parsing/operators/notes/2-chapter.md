**Arithmetic Operators:**

1. **`+`, `-`, `*`, `/` Operators:**
   - Purpose: Used for basic arithmetic operations.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     let "result = 5 + 3"
     ```

2. **`**` Operator (Exponentiation):**
   - Purpose: Raises a number to the power of another.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     let "z = 5**3"  # 5 * 5 * 5
     ```

3. **`%` Operator (Modulo):**
   - Purpose: Returns the remainder of an integer division operation.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     expr 5 % 3  # Returns 2 (remainder of 5/3)
     ```
   - Modulo finds use in generating numbers within a specific range, formatting program output, and even generating prime numbers.

These operators play crucial roles in shell scripting. The assignment operator (`=`) helps manage variables, and the arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`) enable mathematical operations and manipulations. Understanding these concepts is foundational for writing effective and functional shell scripts.
