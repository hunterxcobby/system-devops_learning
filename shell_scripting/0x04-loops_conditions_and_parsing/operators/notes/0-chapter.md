**Variable Assignment:**

1. **`=` Operator:**
   - Purpose: Used for assigning values to variables, both for arithmetic and string assignments.
   - Examples:
     ```bash
     var=27
     category=minerals
     ```

**Caution:**
- Avoid confusion between the assignment (`=`) and test (`=` within `[ ]`) operators.
