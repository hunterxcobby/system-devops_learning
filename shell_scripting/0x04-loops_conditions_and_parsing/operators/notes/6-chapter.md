**Comma Operator:**

1. **`,` (Comma Operator):**
   - Purpose: Chains together two or more arithmetic operations. All operations are evaluated, but the result is set to the value of the last operation.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     let "t1 = ((5 + 3, 7 - 1, 15 - 4))"
     echo "t1 = $t1"  # t1 = 11
     ```
     - In this example, `t1` is set to the result of the last operation (15 - 4).

2. **Use with Assignment:**
   ```bash
   let "t2 = ((a = 9, 15 / 3))"
   echo "t2 = $t2    a = $a"  # t2 = 5    a = 9
   ```
   - Here, `a` is set to 9, and `t2` is set to the result of the second operation (15 / 3).

**Explanation:**
- The comma operator is handy when you want to perform multiple operations in a single statement.
- It's essential to note that the result is based on the last operation in the chain.

**Additional Note:**
- The comma operator can have side effects, such as setting variables, so use it judiciously.
