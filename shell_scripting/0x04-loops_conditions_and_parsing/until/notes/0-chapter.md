### 1. **Overview:**
- The `until` loop is used for repeated execution of a block of statements as long as a specified condition is false.

### 2. **Syntax:**
```bash
until [ condition ]; do
    # Statements to be executed as long as the condition is false
done
```

- The `condition` is a test expression that is evaluated before each iteration.
- If the `condition` is false, the statements within the loop are executed.
- The loop continues executing as long as the `condition` remains false.

### 3. **Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Simple until loop to count from 1 to 5
counter=1

until [ $counter -gt 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $counter"
    ((counter++))
done
```

- In this example, the loop continues executing as long as the value of `counter` is not greater than 5.

### 4. **Key Points:**
   - The `condition` is evaluated before the execution of the loop block.
   - The loop block is enclosed between `do` and `done`.
   - It's important to ensure that the `condition` changes within the loop to avoid an infinite loop. If the condition never becomes true, the loop will run indefinitely.

### 5. **Breaking out of an `until` Loop:**
   - You can use the `break` statement to exit an `until` loop prematurely if a certain condition is met.

   ```bash
   until [ condition ]; do
       # Statements
       if [ some_condition ]; then
           break  # Exit the loop if some_condition is true
       fi
   done
   ```

### 6. **Skipping Iteration:**
   - You can use the `continue` statement to skip the rest of the statements in the current iteration and move to the next one.

   ```bash
   until [ condition ]; do
       # Statements
       if [ some_condition ]; then
           continue  # Skip the rest of the loop body and move to the next iteration
       fi
   done
   ```

### 7. **Infinite Loop:**
   - Be cautious to avoid infinite loops. Ensure that the `condition` changes during the loop execution to eventually become true.

   ```bash
   # Example of an infinite loop
   until false; do
       # Statements
   done
   ```

### 8. **Common Use Cases:**
   - Waiting for a condition to become true before proceeding with the rest of the script.
   - Continuous monitoring or polling until a certain condition is met.
   - Iterating over a range of numbers or elements where the exit condition is based on a certain criterion.

### 9. **Nested `until` Loops:**
   - You can have `until` loops inside other `until` loops.

   ```bash
   until [ condition1 ]; do
       # Statements
       until [ condition2 ]; do
           # Nested statements
       done
   done
   ```

### 10. **Conclusion:**
   - The `until` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it continues executing as long as the specified condition is false.
   - It is useful when you want to execute a block of code until a certain condition becomes true.

This covers the basics of the `until` loop in Bash scripting.
