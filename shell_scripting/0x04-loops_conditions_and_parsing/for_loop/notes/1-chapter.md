**Example 1: Making Backup Copies of .xml Files**

1. **Command Explanation:**
   - `ls *.xml`: Lists all files in the current directory with the .xml extension.
   - `ls *.xml > list`: Creates a list of these .xml files and stores it in a file named 'list'.
   - `for i in `cat list`; do cp "$i" "$i".bak ; done`: For each file in the 'list', it makes a backup copy by appending '.bak' to the filename using the `cp` command.

2. **Real-Life Analogy:**
   - Imagine you have a bunch of important documents (files ending with .xml), and you want to make a backup copy of each before making changes.

3. **Code Breakdown:**
   ```bash
   for i in `cat list`; do
     cp "$i" "$i".bak
   done
   ```
   - `for i in `cat list``: For each item in the 'list' (each .xml file),
   - `cp "$i" "$i".bak`: Make a copy of the file with the same name but adding '.bak' to it.

4. **Result:**
   - After running this, you'll have backup copies of each .xml file with a '.bak' extension.

**Example 2: Checking Plain Text Files in /sbin**

1. **Command Explanation:**
   - `for i in `ls /sbin`; do file /sbin/$i | grep ASCII; done`: For each item in /sbin, it checks if the file is a plain text file using the `file` command and filters the result to show only ASCII files using `grep ASCII`.

2. **Real-Life Analogy:**
   - Think of it like going through a box of mixed items (files in /sbin) and checking each item to see if it's a type of item you're interested in (ASCII files).

3. **Code Breakdown:**
   ```bash
   for i in `ls /sbin`; do
     file /sbin/$i | grep ASCII
   done
   ```
   - `for i in `ls /sbin``: For each item in /sbin,
   - `file /sbin/$i | grep ASCII`: Check the type of the item, and filter to show only if it's ASCII.

4. **Result:**
   - It lists the plain text files in /sbin.

These examples showcase how a for loop can automate tasks, like making backups or filtering specific file types, saving you time and effort.
