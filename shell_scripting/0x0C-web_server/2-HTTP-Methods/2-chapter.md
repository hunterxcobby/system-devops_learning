Let's break down the GET method and its example:

### **Understanding the GET Method with a Real-World Analogy: Fetching a Book from a Library**

1. **GET Method Explained: Retrieving Data**
   - **Real-world Analogy:** Requesting a specific book from a library.
   - **Explanation:** In the HTTP context, the GET method is used to retrieve data from a web server. It's like asking the server to give you a specific resource (in this case, "hello.htm") from its collection.

2. **GET Request Example:**
   - **Real-world Analogy:** Asking the librarian for a book titled "hello.htm."
   - **HTTP Request Example:**
     ```http
     GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
     Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
     Accept-Language: en-us
     Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
     Connection: Keep-Alive
     ```
   - **Explanation:** This is like telling the librarian (web server) that you want the book "hello.htm." The details like language preference and connection instructions are included in the request.

3. **Server Response to GET Request:**
   - **Real-world Analogy:** The librarian handing you the requested book.
   - **HTTP Response Example:**
     ```http
     HTTP/1.1 200 OK

     <body>
     <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```
   - **Explanation:** The server responds with a 200 OK status, indicating success. It provides details about the retrieved resource, such as its type, modification date, and content. The actual content (book) is enclosed in the HTML tags.

### **Conclusion:**
The GET method is like requesting a specific book from a library, where you provide details about your request, and the librarian responds by giving you the requested book along with additional information.
