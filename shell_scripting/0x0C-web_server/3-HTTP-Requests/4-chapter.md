### **307 Moved Temporarily: Overview**

#### **Definition:**
- **Type:** Temporary Redirect
- **HTTP Status Code:** 307

#### **Key Characteristics:**
1. **Successor to 302:**
   - The 307 status code is the successor of the 302 Found redirect in the HTTP 1.1 protocol.

2. **Temporary Nature:**
   - Indicates that the requested resource (URL) has been temporarily moved to another location.

3. **Similar to 302:**
   - In many cases, major search engines may treat a 307 redirect similarly to a 302, especially if the server has been identified as HTTP 1.1 compatible.

4. **Use for Temporary Moves:**
   - Best suited for scenarios where content has been temporarily moved, such as during maintenance or other short-term situations.

#### **Considerations:**
1. **301 vs. 307:**
   - While a 307 redirect can be used for temporary moves, it is generally recommended to use a 301 for almost all cases.

2. **Identification by Search Engines:**
   - Determining whether search engines have identified a page as HTTP 1.1 compatible is challenging, making 302 or 307 redirects less predictable.

#### **Implementation Example:**
- **Apache `.htaccess` Configuration:**
  ```apache
  Redirect 307 /temporary-move http://example.com/new-location
  ```

### **Conclusion:**
A 307 Temporary Redirect is utilized when a URL change is temporary, and the original URL is expected to be active again. While it can be treated similarly to a 302 by major search engines, the use of a 301 redirect is generally recommended for most cases.
