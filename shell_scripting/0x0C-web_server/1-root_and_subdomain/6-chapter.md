### **Analogy: Subdomain with a Path as a Building with Different Sections**

1. **Building Name (Root Domain):**
   - Imagine your root domain, like "MyCompany Headquarters" (e.g., mycompany.com), as a large building representing your entire online presence.

2. **Subdomain (Section of the Building):**
   - Now, think of a subdomain as a specific section within the building, say "Marketing Wing" (e.g., marketing.mycompany.com). This is a dedicated space for all your marketing activities.

3. **Path/Subfolder (Rooms in the Section):**
   - Within the "Marketing Wing," you have various rooms, each serving a unique purpose. For instance, "Limited Offers Room" (path: /limitedoffer) or "Event Hall" (path: /event) are distinct areas within the Marketing Wing.

### **Explanation:**

- **Building Name (Root Domain):**
  - The root domain represents the entire building or online presence. In this case, it's "MyCompany Headquarters" (mycompany.com).

- **Subdomain (Section of the Building):**
  - Subdomains are like specific wings or sections within the building, each dedicated to a particular aspect. "Marketing Wing" (marketing.mycompany.com) is one such example.

- **Path/Subfolder (Rooms in the Section):**
  - Paths or subfolders within a subdomain are analogous to different rooms or areas within a specific section. These paths, like "/limitedoffer" or "/event," represent distinct spaces for specific content or activities.

### **Publishing Pages to Paths:**

- **Adding Rooms to Sections:**
  - Just as you can add rooms to different sections of a building, you can publish landing pages to specific paths within a subdomain. For example, "/limitedoffer" and "/event" are like rooms within the "Marketing Wing."

- **No Limit to Pages:**
  - There's no limit to how many landing pages (rooms) you can create within a path. Each path serves as a unique space for showcasing different content or campaigns.

### **Technical Steps:**

1. **Landingi Dashboard:**
   - Think of the Landingi dashboard as your building's control center. It's where you manage different sections (subdomains) and rooms (paths).

2. **Publishing Options:**
   - Clicking on "More" and going to the "Publishing Options" tab is like navigating through the control center to manage specific sections.

3. **Changing URL:**
   - Changing the URL is akin to customizing a room within a section. You select a subdomain (section), enter a path name (room name), and save changes.

### **Conclusion:**
In essence, a subdomain with a path is comparable to having different sections within a building, and each section contains various rooms serving distinct purposes. Paths allow you to organize and showcase specific content or campaigns within a dedicated subdomain.
