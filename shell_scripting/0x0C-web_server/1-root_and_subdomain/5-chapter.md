### **Analogy: Subdomains as Rooms in a Building**

1. **Root Domain (Building Name):**
   - Picture the root domain as the name of a building, like "MyCompany Tower" (e.g., mycompany.com). It represents the entire structure.

2. **Subdomain (Room Name):**
   - Now, think of a subdomain as a specific room within "MyCompany Tower." For instance, home.mycompany.com is like a room named "Home" in the building.

### **Explanation:**

- **Root Domain (Building Name):**
  - The root domain is the main identity, akin to the building's name. It's what people recognize first (e.g., mycompany.com).

- **Subdomain (Room Name):**
  - Subdomains are like individual rooms inside the building. Each subdomain (e.g., home.mycompany.com) has its unique purpose or content, just like different rooms serve specific functions.

### **Significance of Subdomains:**

- **Division of Spaces:**
  - Subdomains help divide the overall space (root domain) into specific areas. It's like having designated rooms for different activities or information.

- **Campaign Foundation:**
  - Adding a subdomain to Landingi is comparable to preparing a room for a specific event or purpose within the building. It forms the foundation for your advertising campaign.

### **Creating Subdomains:**

- **Ownership and Creation:**
  - When you buy a domain name (e.g., mycompany.com), it's like owning the entire building. Subdomains (e.g., voucher.mycompany.com) are rooms you create within that building.

- **Unlimited Possibilities:**
  - Just as you can have many rooms in a building, you can create numerous subdomains under your domain name. They offer flexibility and organization.

### **Technical Aspect: Redirecting via A Records:**

- **A Records (Directions):**
  - Redirecting a subdomain involves pointing it to the right location, similar to putting directions to a specific room. This is done via A records, ensuring visitors reach the correct space.

- **SSL Certificate:**
  - Installing an SSL certificate on a subdomain is akin to securing a specific room for confidential discussions. It ensures a secure connection for that particular space.

### **Registrar and DNS Management:**

- **Registrar's Role:**
  - Your domain registrar is like the manager of the building. It handles domain-related tasks, including the creation of subdomains.

- **DNS Zone Configuration:**
  - DNS zone configuration is like arranging the layout of rooms. It helps organize and direct traffic within the building.

### **Conclusion:**
In summary, a subdomain is like a room inside a building (root domain). Each subdomain has its unique purpose, and adding one to Landingi is equivalent to preparing a room for a specific campaign or activity. Understanding subdomains provides a structured way to organize and showcase different aspects of your online presence.
