**Step 6: Starting and Testing Replication**

**Overview:**
- Starting replication involves configuring the replica server to connect to the source, followed by testing to ensure data replication is successful.
- The process includes setting replication parameters, verifying replication status, and testing data replication.

**Analogies:**
- Starting replication is akin to synchronizing two clocks to ensure they show the same time, while testing replication is like comparing the readings of both clocks to confirm they match.

**Procedure:**
1. **Configure Replica Server:**
   - Access the MySQL shell on the replica server:
     ```
     sudo mysql
     ```
   - Configure replication settings to connect to the source and start replication:
     ```
     CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
     SOURCE_HOST='source_server_ip',
     SOURCE_USER='replica_user',
     SOURCE_PASSWORD='password',
     SOURCE_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001',
     SOURCE_LOG_POS=899;

     START REPLICA;
     ```

2. **Verify Replication Status:**
   - Check the replica's replication status for confirmation:
     ```
     SHOW REPLICA STATUS\G;
     ```

3. **Test Data Replication:**
   - Open the MySQL shell on the source server and select the replicated database:
     ```
     sudo mysql
     USE db;
     ```
   - Create a sample table and optionally add data to it:
     ```
     CREATE TABLE example_table (
     example_column varchar(30)
     );

     INSERT INTO example_table VALUES
     ('This is the first row'),
     ('This is the second row'),
     ('This is the third row');
     ```
   - Switch to the replica server's MySQL shell, select the replicated database, and verify the table's presence:
     ```
     USE db;
     SHOW TABLES;
     ```
   - Check if the data was replicated successfully:
     ```
     SELECT * FROM example_table;
     ```

**Conclusion:**
- Replication is successfully configured and tested between the source and replica MySQL instances, ensuring synchronized data replication.

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor replication status regularly to ensure ongoing synchronization.
- Troubleshoot any issues encountered during replication and refer to MySQL documentation for further assistance.
