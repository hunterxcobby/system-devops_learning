**Step 4: Retrieving Binary Log Coordinates from the Source**

**Overview:**
- MySQL replication requires specifying coordinates (binary log file and position) from the source database to start replicating data on the replica.
- This step involves obtaining the current binary log coordinates from the source database and optionally migrating existing data to the replica.

**Analogies:**
- Obtaining binary log coordinates is like noting the exact page and paragraph in a book where you left off reading, ensuring you resume from the correct point next time.

**Procedure:**
1. **Lock Database Tables:**
   - From the MySQL shell on the source server, run:
     ```
     FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
     ```
   - This prevents any clients from reading or writing data during the coordinate retrieval process.

2. **Retrieve Binary Log Coordinates:**
   - Still in the MySQL shell, execute:
     ```
     SHOW MASTER STATUS;
     ```
   - Note down the `File` name and `Position` values for later use.

3. **Unlock Tables:**
   - If your source database has no existing data to migrate, unlock tables:
     ```
     UNLOCK TABLES;
     ```
   - Otherwise, proceed with the data migration process.

4. **Data Migration (Optional):**
   - If migrating existing data, open a new terminal window/tab and SSH into the source server:
     ```
     ssh username@source_server_ip
     ```
   - Export the database using `mysqldump`:
     ```
     sudo mysqldump -u root db > db.sql
     ```
   - Transfer the snapshot to the replica server using `scp`:
     ```
     scp db.sql username@replica_server_ip:/tmp/
     ```
   - SSH into the replica server:
     ```
     ssh username@replica_server_ip
     ```
   - Import the database snapshot:
     ```
     sudo mysql db < /tmp/db.sql
     ```

5. **Conclusion:**
   - You have retrieved the binary log coordinates from the source database and optionally migrated existing data to the replica, ensuring synchronization between the two databases.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to configure the replica server to begin replicating changes made on the source database.
