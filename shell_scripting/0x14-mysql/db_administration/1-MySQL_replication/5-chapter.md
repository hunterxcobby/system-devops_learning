**Step 3: Creating a Replication User**

**Overview:**
- In MySQL replication, each replica connects to the source database using a dedicated username and password.
- This step involves creating a new MySQL user specifically for replication purposes and granting them the necessary privileges.

**Analogies:**
- Creating a replication user is like issuing a special pass to a designated individual who needs access to certain areas in a building, ensuring only authorized personnel can enter restricted zones.

**Procedure:**
1. **Open MySQL Shell:**
   - Access the MySQL shell using the following command:
     ```
     sudo mysql
     ```
   - Alternatively, if you have a dedicated MySQL user with a password, use:
     ```
     mysql -u username -p
     ```
   - Replace `username` with your dedicated MySQL user's name and enter the password when prompted.

2. **Create a New MySQL User:**
   - Execute the following command to create a new MySQL user named `replica_user`. Replace `replica_server_ip` with your replica server's public IP address, and set a strong password:
     ```
     CREATE USER 'replica_user'@'replica_server_ip' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
     ```
   - Note: This command specifies the use of the `mysql_native_password` authentication plugin.

3. **Grant Privileges to the User:**
   - Grant the necessary replication privileges to the newly created user:
     ```
     GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica_user'@'replica_server_ip';
     ```

4. **Flush Privileges:**
   - Run the following command to ensure the privileges are updated:
     ```
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

5. **Keep MySQL Shell Open:**
   - Do not exit the MySQL shell yet, as you'll need it for the next step to obtain information about the source database's binary log file.

**Conclusion:**
- You've successfully created a dedicated MySQL user for replication purposes and granted them the necessary privileges to connect to the source database.
- This user will be used by the replica server to establish a connection and synchronize data with the source database.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to the next step to obtain important information about the source database's binary log file, which is crucial for configuring the replica server.
