**Step 1: Adjusting Firewall Settings**

**Overview:**
- Configuring firewall rules ensures secure communication between the source and replica MySQL servers.
- By allowing specific connections through the firewall, you enable replication functionality.

**Analogies:**
- Imagine the firewall as a security gate: without the right access, no one can enter.
- Adjusting firewall rules is like granting specific individuals (replica server) permission to pass through the gate.

**Procedure:**
1. **Identify Replica Server's IP Address:**
   - Obtain the IP address of your replica server, which acts as the entrance point.

2. **Adjust Source Server's Firewall:**
   - Run the following command on the source server to allow incoming connections from the replica server to MySQL's port 3306:
     ```
     sudo ufw allow from replica_server_ip to any port 3306
     ```
     Replace `replica_server_ip` with the actual IP address of your replica server.
   
3. **Verification:**
   - If the rule is added successfully, you'll see the output: "Rule added."

**Analogies:**
- Adding the firewall rule is akin to installing a special gate allowing specific guests to enter your premises.
- Verifying the rule confirms that the gate is properly set up and guests can pass through as intended.

**Conclusion:**
- Adjusting firewall settings ensures secure communication between the source and replica MySQL servers, enabling smooth replication functionality.
- This step enhances the overall security and reliability of your database replication setup.
