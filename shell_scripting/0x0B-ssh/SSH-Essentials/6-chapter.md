### Copying Your Public SSH Key to a Server - Choose Your Path Wisely:

1. **With `ssh-copy-id` Magic:**
   - If `ssh-copy-id` is your ally, and password-based SSH access is active:

     ```bash
     ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
     ```

   - Provide the password, and your key will dance into `authorized_keys`.

2. **Without `ssh-copy-id` - The Manual Dance:**
   - In the absence of `ssh-copy-id`, but with password-based SSH access:

     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@remote_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
     ```

   - Password input required, and your key shall find its place.

3. **Manual Copy - When All Else Fails:**
   - If password-based SSH is a distant dream, manually copy your public key:

     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```

   - Copy the displayed key, log into the server through other means, and:

     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.ssh
     echo copied_public_key_string >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```

   - Unlock the magic of passwordless SSH.

Now, you hold the knowledge to let your SSH key travel to distant servers, bringing forth the era of secure, passwordless connections. May your logins be swift and your servers secure.
