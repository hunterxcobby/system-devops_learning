### How SSH Works - Simplified

**SSH Connection:** Think of SSH like a secure messenger between your computer and a remote server. When you connect, you're entering a special chat room where your messages are coded so that only the server understands.

**Client-Server Model:** Imagine you're sending messages to a friend in a secret language. Your friend has a special doorbell (SSH daemon) that rings when you want to connect. If your friend recognizes your secret knock (authentication), they let you in.

**Shell Session:** Once inside, it's like being in a room (shell session) where you can talk directly to the server. Everything you say (commands) goes through the secret messenger (SSH).

**Authentication Methods:**
- **Passwords:** It's like telling your friend a secret code to enter. However, it's less secure because anyone who guesses the code can get in.
- **SSH Keys:** This is like having a special key that only your friend recognizes. You show your key, and if it matches the one your friend has, you're allowed in.

**SSH Keys Process:** When you use keys, it's like showing a special ID card. The server checks if your ID is on the approved list. It sends you a challenge, and you prove you have the right ID by solving it with your private key.

**Key Security:** Your ID card (public key) is shared freely, but your secret key (private key) is like your personal diary. Never share it. The server recognizes you by your ID card but can't unlock your diary.

**Secure Communication:** All your messages between your computer and the server are locked in a secure box (encrypted tunnel). Even if someone tries to listen, they can't understand the coded conversation.
