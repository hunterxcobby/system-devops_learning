**HTTP Response Header: An Overview**

After receiving the request header from the client's browser, the web server sends back an HTTP response header. This response header comprises textual information transmitted from the server to the client's browser. It includes details such as:

- **File type, date, and size:** The response header specifies the type of file being sent back (e.g., HTML, image, PDF), the date and time the file was generated or last modified, and its size in bytes.

- **Server information:** The header may contain information about the server, such as its software and version, enabling the client to identify the server it's communicating with.

**In Simple Terms:**

When the server responds to your request, it sends a header that tells your browser what kind of file it's sending (like HTML or an image), when it was last modified, how big it is, and what server it's coming from.

**Example:**

If you request an HTML webpage, the HTTP response header might include information like "Content-Type: text/html", "Last-Modified: Mon, 10 Jan 2023 12:00:00 GMT", "Content-Length: 5120", and "Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Unix)".

**Conclusion:**

The HTTP response header provides important details about the file being sent from the server to the client's browser, including its type, size, modification date, and server information. This information helps the client process and display the received content appropriately.
