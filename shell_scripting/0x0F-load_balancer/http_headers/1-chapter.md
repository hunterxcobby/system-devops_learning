**Definition of HTTP Header:**

HTTP headers are pairs of name and value included in both request and response messages of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). These headers facilitate communication between the client (e.g., web browser) and the server by conveying additional information about the request or response.

**Explanation:**

HTTP headers consist of a name-value pair separated by a colon (:). They are essential components of HTTP requests and responses, providing crucial details such as content type, caching directives, authentication credentials, and more.

**In Simple Terms:**

HTTP headers serve as the language that enables communication between a web server and a client (e.g., a web browser). They convey important information about the data being transferred, ensuring efficient and effective communication between the two parties.

**Example:**

In an HTTP request, a header like "Content-Type: application/json" indicates that the content being sent is in JSON format. Similarly, in an HTTP response, headers like "Content-Length: 1234" specify the length of the content being returned to the client.

**Conclusion:**

HTTP headers play a vital role in the exchange of data between web servers and clients. By providing additional information about requests and responses, they facilitate seamless communication and enable various functionalities in web applications.
