**Types of Load Balancing:**

1. **No Load Balancing:**
   - In a no load balancing setup, users connect directly to a single web server (e.g., yourdomain.com).
   - There's no load distribution, so if the server goes down, users can't access the website.
   - High traffic can overload the server, leading to slow or failed connections for users.

2. **Layer 4 Load Balancing:**
   - Layer 4 load balancing operates at the transport layer, forwarding traffic based on IP range and port.
   - Requests are directed to backend servers based on IP and port information.
   - All servers in the backend should serve identical content to ensure consistency.

3. **Layer 7 Load Balancing:**
   - Layer 7 load balancing functions at the application layer, allowing routing based on content in the user's request.
   - Requests are forwarded to different backend servers depending on the request content.
   - Enables running multiple web application servers under the same domain and port.

**Frontend Configuration Example:**
```
frontend http
  bind *:80
  mode http

  acl url_blog path_beg /blog
  use_backend blog-backend if url_blog

  default_backend web-backend
```
- Configures a frontend named `http` to handle incoming traffic on port 80.
- ACL `url_blog` matches requests with paths beginning with `/blog`.
- Forwards matched requests to `blog-backend`.
- Sends all other traffic to `web-backend`.

**Conclusion:**
Load balancing helps distribute network traffic across multiple servers for improved reliability and performance. Layer 4 load balancing directs traffic based on IP and port, while layer 7 load balancing routes requests based on content. Proper load balancing configuration is essential for efficient resource utilization and ensuring seamless user experience.
