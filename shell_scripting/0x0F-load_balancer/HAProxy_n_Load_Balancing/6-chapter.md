**Load Balancing Algorithms:**

1. **Round Robin:**
   - Selects servers in turns, distributing requests equally among them.
   - Default algorithm where servers are chosen sequentially.
   - Useful when all servers have similar capabilities and there's no specific requirement for request handling.

2. **Least Connections:**
   - Selects the server with the fewest active connections.
   - Recommended for longer sessions where balancing the load based on current connections is crucial.
   - Servers in the same backend are rotated in a round-robin fashion to distribute load evenly.

3. **Source Hashing:**
   - Selects a server based on a hash of the source IP address of the user's request.
   - Ensures that the same users consistently connect to the same servers.
   - Useful for maintaining session persistence or directing specific users to designated servers.

4. **Sticky Sessions (Appsession):**
   - Ensures that a user continues to connect to the same backend server for the duration of their session.
   - Achieved through sticky sessions, where a unique session identifier is used to associate a user's requests with a specific server.
   - Implemented using the `appsession` parameter in the backend configuration for applications that require session persistence.

**Conclusion:**
Choosing the appropriate load balancing algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as session persistence, resource utilization, and performance. Each algorithm offers different strategies for distributing traffic among backend servers, catering to various use cases and optimizing server selection based on factors like current load and user sessions.
