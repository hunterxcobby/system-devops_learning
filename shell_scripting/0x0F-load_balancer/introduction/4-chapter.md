The weighted scheduling algorithm is used to distribute workload among servers based on their assigned weights, which reflect their capabilities or specifications. Here's how it works:

1. **Weight Assignment:**
   - Each server in the server farm or cluster is assigned a weight based on its hardware capabilities. This weight is determined by administrators to reflect the server's capacity to handle requests.

2. **Load Distribution:**
   - When requests (R1, R2, ..., R10) come into the system, the load balancer calculates the percentage of traffic to be sent to each server based on its assigned weight.
   - Servers with higher weights receive a higher percentage of incoming requests, while servers with lower weights receive a lower percentage.

3. **Efficient Resource Utilization:**
   - This algorithm ensures that servers with higher capabilities handle a larger portion of the workload, while still utilizing all available servers.
   - It prevents overloading low-capacity servers by distributing the workload according to each server's capacity.

4. **Types of Load Balancers:**
   - Load balancers can be hardware-based or software-based.
   - **Software Load Balancers:** Installed on servers, they consume processor and memory resources of the servers. In the diagram, the software load balancer overlaps the server farm.
   - **Hardware Load Balancers:** Specialized hardware deployed between servers and clients. They can be routing or switching hardware or dedicated systems running load balancing software with specialized capabilities.

The weighted scheduling algorithm is beneficial when there's a significant difference in server capabilities within the farm or cluster. It optimizes resource utilization by distributing workload proportionally to each server's capacity, enhancing overall system performance and reliability.
