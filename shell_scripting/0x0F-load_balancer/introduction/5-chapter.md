The Round Robin scheduling algorithm distributes requests to servers sequentially, one after another, in a circular manner. Here's how it works:

1. **Sequential Assignment:**
   - Requests are assigned to servers in a sequential order, starting from the first server in the list.
   - Each incoming request is routed to the next server in the sequence.

2. **Circular Rotation:**
   - Once the last server in the list receives a request, the algorithm loops back to the first server and continues the sequence.
   - This circular rotation ensures that each server gets an equal share of requests over time.

3. **Equal Specification Servers:**
   - Round Robin is effective when servers have similar specifications and capabilities.
   - Since requests are evenly distributed among servers, it helps balance the workload across all servers.

4. **Transient Connections:**
   - This algorithm is suitable when there are not many persistent connections or long-lived sessions between clients and servers.
   - Requests are served in a stateless manner, and there's no dependency on previous interactions with the servers.

In the diagram,

Round Robin is a straightforward and fair approach to load balancing, ensuring that each server receives an equal number of requests over time. However, it may not be suitable for scenarios with varying server capacities or persistent connections.
