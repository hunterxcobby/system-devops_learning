The Least Connection First scheduling algorithm prioritizes servers with the fewest active connections to handle incoming requests. Here's how it works:

1. **Dynamic Assignment:**
   - Requests are directed to the server that currently has the lowest number of active connections.
   - This dynamic assignment ensures that servers with lighter loads receive new requests, optimizing resource utilization.

2. **Balancing Load:**
   - By distributing requests based on connection count, this algorithm aims to balance the workload across servers.
   - Servers with fewer active connections are favored to maintain a more even distribution of requests.

3. **Session Persistence:**
   - Least Connection First is often used in conjunction with session-aware load balancing, where all requests from a particular client session are routed to the same server.
   - This ensures session state consistency and synchronization, especially in scenarios with session-related write operations.

4. **Handling Persistent Connections:**
   - It's particularly useful when dealing with a large number of persistent connections, especially if these connections are unevenly distributed among servers.
   - The algorithm helps in efficiently managing resources and avoiding overloading specific servers.

In the diagram, if request R5 arrives when all servers have the same number of connections, it will be randomly assigned to any server. However, if a server becomes available (e.g., server S3 becomes free due to the completion of request R3), the incoming request (R5) will be assigned to the server with the least number of connections (in this case, server S3).

Least Connection First scheduling is effective in scenarios where maintaining session state and synchronization is crucial, and where the workload varies dynamically among servers. It's often used alongside other load balancing techniques for optimal performance.
