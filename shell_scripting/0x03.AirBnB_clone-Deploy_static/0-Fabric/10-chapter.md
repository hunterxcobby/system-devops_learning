In Fabric, the `get` function is used to download files from a remote system to the local machine. Here are some examples of how you can use `get`:

1. **Downloading logs from the remote system to a local directory:**
   ```python
   get(remote_path="/tmp/log_extracts.tar.gz", local_path="/logs/new_log.tar.gz")
   ```

2. **Downloading a database backup from the remote system to the current directory:**
   ```python
   get("/backup/db.gz", "./db.gz")
   ```

With `get`, you can easily retrieve files from a remote system, which is useful for tasks like downloading backups, logs, or other server-related items to your local machine.
