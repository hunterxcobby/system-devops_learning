Fabric's context managers, used with Python's `with` statement, provide a convenient way to manage states and configurations during the execution of commands. These context managers help in organizing and executing commands in a specific environment or path.

1. **cd (fabric.context_managers.cd):**
   - `cd` context manager allows executing commands relative to a specified directory path.
   - Example:
     ```python
     with cd("/tmp/trunk"):
         items = sudo("ls -l")
     ```

2. **lcd (fabric.context_managers.lcd):**
   - `lcd` context manager (local cd) changes the local working directory for local commands.
   - Example:
     ```python
     with lcd("~/projects/my_project"):
         put("app.tar.gz", "/tmp/trunk/app.tar.gz")
     ```

3. **path (fabric.context_managers.path):**
   - `path` context manager alters the PATH variable.
   - This context manager is not extensively described in the provided text.

4. **settings (fabric.context_managers.settings):**
   - `settings` context manager temporarily overrides `env` values for a specific command chain.
   - Example:
     ```python
     with settings(user="user1"):
         sudo("cmd")
     ```

5. **prefix (fabric.context_managers.prefix):**
   - `prefix` context manager wraps given `run` and `sudo` commands with the specified one.
   - Example:
     ```python
     with prefix("cmd arg."):
         run("./start")
     ```

These context managers in Fabric help in streamlining the execution of commands by providing a structured and organized approach, enhancing the automation of management tasks.
