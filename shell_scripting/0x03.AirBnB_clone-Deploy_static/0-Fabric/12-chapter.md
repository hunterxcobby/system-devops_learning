In Fabric, the `prompt` function allows you to interactively prompt the user for input during script execution. Here are some examples of how you can use `prompt`:

1. **Prompting the user for input:**
   ```python
   port_number = prompt("Which port would you like to use?")
   ```

2. **Prompting the user with default values and input validation:**
   ```python
   port_number = prompt("Which port?", default=42, validate=int)
   ```
   In this example, the default value is set to 42, and the `validate` argument specifies that the input must be an integer.

`prompt` provides flexibility when you need to gather user input dynamically during script execution, allowing you to tailor the behavior of your Fabric scripts based on user responses.
