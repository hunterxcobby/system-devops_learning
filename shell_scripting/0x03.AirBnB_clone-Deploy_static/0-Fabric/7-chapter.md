In Fabric, the `run` procedure is used to execute shell commands on one or more remote hosts. Here are some examples of how you can use `run`:

1. **Creating a directory:**
   ```python
   run("mkdir /tmp/trunk/")
   ```

2. **Checking system uptime:**
   ```python
   run("uptime")
   ```

3. **Getting the hostname of the remote host:**
   ```python
   run("hostname")
   ```

4. **Capturing the output of a command:**
   ```python
   result = run("ls -l /var/www")
   ```

5. **Checking if the command failed:**
   ```python
   if result.failed:
       print("Command execution failed!")
   ```

By using `run`, you can execute various shell commands on remote hosts and capture their output for further processing or error handling.
