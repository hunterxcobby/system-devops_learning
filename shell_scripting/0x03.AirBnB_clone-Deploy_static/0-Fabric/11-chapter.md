In Fabric, the `put` function is used to upload files from the local machine to a remote system. Here are some examples of how you can use `put`:

1. **Uploading a tar archive of an application from the local machine to a specific directory on the remote system:**
   ```python
   put("/local/path/to/app.tar.gz", "/tmp/trunk/app.tar.gz")
   ```

2. **Using the context manager `cd` to upload a file to a specific directory on the remote system:**
   ```python
   with cd("/tmp"):
       put("local/path/to/app.tar.gz", "trunk")
   ```

3. **Uploading a file and setting the desired mode (permissions) on the remote system:**
   ```python
   upload = put("requirements.txt", "requirements.txt", mode=664)
   ```

4. **Verifying if the upload was successful:**
   ```python
   upload.succeeded
   ```

With `put`, you can easily transfer files from your local machine to a remote system, making it convenient for tasks like deploying applications or transferring configuration files.
