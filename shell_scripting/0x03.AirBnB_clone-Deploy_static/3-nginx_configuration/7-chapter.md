A proxy, in the context of computer networking, acts as an intermediary between a client device (such as a computer or smartphone) and the destination server or resource it is trying to access on the internet. The proxy server receives requests from the client and forwards them to the destination server, then relays the response back to the client.

**Analogy:** Imagine you want to request a book from a library, but you prefer not to go to the library yourself. Instead, you give a friend a list of books you want, and your friend goes to the library, picks up the books for you, and brings them back to you. In this scenario:

- You (the client) are the person who wants to read the books.
- Your friend (the proxy server) acts on your behalf to retrieve the books.
- The library (the destination server) is where the books are located.

In computer networking:

- **You (the client)**: Your device, like a computer or smartphone, trying to access a website or service on the internet.
- **Your friend (the proxy server)**: The proxy server you configure to handle your internet requests on your behalf.
- **The library (the destination server)**: The website or service you want to access on the internet.

Just like how your friend facilitates your access to books from the library without you having to go there yourself, a proxy server facilitates your access to websites or services on the internet without directly connecting to them. It can also provide additional functionalities like caching content, filtering requests, or enhancing security and privacy.
