Understanding Nginx Basics:

1. **Introduction to Nginx**: Nginx is a web server software known for its high performance, stability, and low resource consumption. It's commonly used to serve web content and as a reverse proxy.

2. **Installation**: Before proceeding, ensure Nginx is installed on your machine. If not, refer to the official documentation for installation instructions.

3. **Master and Worker Processes**: Nginx operates with one master process and multiple worker processes. The master process manages configurations and controls worker processes. Worker processes handle actual request processing. Nginx's event-based model efficiently distributes requests among worker processes.

4. **Configuration File**: Nginx's behavior and functionality are defined in its configuration file, usually named `nginx.conf`. This file is located in directories like `/usr/local/nginx/conf`, `/etc/nginx`, or `/usr/local/etc/nginx`. The configuration file structure determines how Nginx handles requests and serves content.

5. **Worker Processes Configuration**: The number of worker processes is specified in the configuration file, typically using the `worker_processes` directive. This number can be fixed or automatically adjusted based on the available CPU cores.

By understanding these basic concepts, you'll be ready to explore and configure Nginx for various tasks, such as serving static content, setting up as a proxy server, or connecting with FastCGI applications.
