### Overview of Popular Configuration Management Tools - Simplified

| **Tool** | **Script Language** | **Infrastructure** | **Requires Specialized Software for Nodes** | **Centralized Control** | **Script Terminology** | **Task Execution Order** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ansible** | YAML | Controller machine applies configuration on nodes via SSH | No | No. Any computer can be a controller | Playbook / Roles | Sequential |
| **Puppet** | Custom DSL based on Ruby | Puppet Master synchronizes configuration on Puppet Nodes | Yes | Yes, via Puppet Master | Manifests / Modules | Non-Sequential |
| **Chef** | Ruby | Chef Workstations push configuration to Chef Server, from which the Chef Nodes will be updated | Yes | Yes, via Chef Server | Recipes / Cookbooks | Sequential |

**Real-life Analogy:** Choosing a configuration management tool is like selecting a method to assemble a pizza. Ansible is like having a recipe card that anyone can follow (YAML), Puppet is like a head chef instructing each cook (Puppet Master), and Chef is like a team of chefs preparing ingredients and sending them to a central kitchen (Chef Workstations and Server).
